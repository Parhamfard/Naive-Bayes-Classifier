# Naive Bayes Classifier Visualization

This project provides a visualization of the Naive Bayes classifier using a synthetic dataset with two features. The model is trained to classify data points into two classes, "Spam" and "Not Spam", and the decision boundary is visualized.

## Features

- Naive Bayes Classifier**: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
- Data Visualization**: Plots data points and decision boundaries for two classes
- Synthetic Dataset**: A generated dataset with two features and two classes
